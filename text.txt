Meta Data:
Meta data is data about the data or documentation about the information which is required by
the users. In data warehousing, metadata is one of the essential aspects. For example, a table of
content and the index of book may be treated metadata for the book.
Key features of metadata:
 The location and descriptions of warehouse systems and components.
 Names, definitions, structures, and content of data-warehouse and end-users views.
 Identification of authoritative data sources.
 Integration and transformation rules used to populate data.
 Subscription information for information delivery to analysis subscription.
 Metrics used to analyze warehouse usage and performance.
 Security authorizations, access control list, etc.Need for Data Warehousing
Data Warehouse is needed for the following reasons:
Business User: Business users require a data warehouse to view summarized data from the
past. Since these people are non-technical, the data may be presented to them in an
elementary form.
Store historical data: Data Warehouse is required to store the time variable data from the
past. This input is made to be used for various purposes.
Make strategic decisions: Some strategies may be depending upon the data in the data
warehouse. So, data warehouse contributes to making strategic decisions.
For data consistency and quality: Bringing the data from different sources at a
commonplace, the user can effectively undertake to bring the uniformity and consistency
in data.
High response time: Data warehouse has to be ready for somewhat unexpected loads and
types of queries, which demands a significant degree of flexibility and quick response time.
Trends in Data Warehousing
Since, their early iteration, in 1980s, Datawarehouses are now faster, more powerful and in
the cloud. And hasn’t chang
